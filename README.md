# SSRS-Migrate
This is a powershell script + a python compiled file to help migrate SSRS reports, shared datasources, datasets, as well as to help migrate Report Parts from one database to another.

When doing migrations and retaining the database, it can be noticed how slow the new system is with the old databse, one way to fix this is to create a blank database, and copy ALL the contents of the original database to this.
...
This script helps in doing this.
